            <p>AceOn Group, UK renewable energy and battery specialists, are very pleased to announce that its development of ‘HIGHESS’ has been awarded significant grant funding from Innovate UK. This transformative project is set to revolutionise energy access in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Commencing in May 2024, this two-year project, led by AceOn as the primary partner, is a synergy of innovation and sustainability aimed at developing high-capacity flexible energy storage systems (HIGHESS).</p><p>AceOn’s pivotal role in HIGHESS is complemented by strategic partnerships with In2tec, a renowned name in sustainable electronics, Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU), a leader in energy systems research, and Nevadic Solar, a major Nigerian supplier of solar products. These collaborations are set to enhance the project’s impact through shared expertise and resources.</p><p>In2tec will leverage its expertise in recyclable electronics to advance AceOn’s Battery Management System (BMS), Inverter, and Power Conditioning Unit (PCU) developments, further elevating the project’s sustainable footprint. LJMU, as the project’s academic partner, will contribute its extensive experience in energy systems, digital twin/data analytics, and predictive maintenance, developing a digital interface for HIGHESS’s remote management system. This integration will enable real-time data collection, facilitating proactive maintenance and performance management.</p><p>Nevadic Solar headquartered in Nigeria, plays a crucial role in the project. The company’s expertise in solar power integration and its established presence in the mini-grid ecosystem will be instrumental in commercialising HIGHESS in Nigeria and wider Sub-Saharan Africa. Their contribution extends to providing facilities, distribution channels, and insights into energy storage installation, testing, and maintenance for diverse end-users.</p><p>Mark Thompson, CEO of AceOn Group, commented, “HIGHESS is not just a project; it’s a commitment to empowering communities and bridging energy access gaps in regions where access to reliable electricity is very challenging. Our vision is to bring sustainable and affordable energy solutions to Sub-Saharan Africa, leveraging our expertise in energy engineering and innovative technologies whilst using second life EV batteries and reusable electronics. This collaboration for UK companies to deliver long term solutions to the world is very exciting to say the least. “</p><p>HIGHESS aligns with global sustainability goals, aiming to provide off-grid electricity from clean energy sources and reduce the reliance on diesel-powered generators. This initiative is a significant step towards sustainable economic development, gender equality, and improved well-being in Africa, Asia and Indo-Pacific communities.</p><p>AceOn, which is based in Telford, Shropshire and which recently expanded, opening a new office in Solihull, has more than 30 years’ experience in the design and manufacture of custom-built battery packs, supporting the development of new battery technologies and products, and the distribution of industrial and consumer batteries to the worldwide market. The energy division offer a full turn-key solution for portable, mobile and commercial battery energy storage systems.</p><p>Mark and AceOn have been selected by the UK Government as one of its Export Champions 23/24.</p><p>This funding award by Innovate UK was announced by the UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as part of a £316m package of announcements in support of an inclusive and just transition at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai.</p><p>HIGHESS is a 1.4M project and has been awarded the money from part of the Ayrton Fund for clean energy innovation, with this funding provided by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) through the Transforming Energy Access (TEA) platform, and the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT), which will be run by Innovate UK.</p><p>For more information about HIGHESS and AceOn Group’s efforts in sustainable energy solutions, visit AceOn Group’s website. </p><p>#energycataylst #UKAid #ArytonFund</p>	</div>
